A blog website where anyone can register, login, then write an article. It uses express.js and server-side rendering via a templating engine. Each password is encrypted with a salt and hash before itâ€™s sent to the database. Sessions persist by using JSON web tokens and storing them as cookies in the browser. Used to be a herokuapp, but the free tier got changed so it's just source code for now.
